We need to create a notes app.

1. Implement the add note functionality.
 - Create a constant that keeps track of the title and constant.
 - Pass the new note back to the app.
 - Add the new note to an array.
 - Take array and render separate Note components for each item.

2. Implement the delete note functionality.
